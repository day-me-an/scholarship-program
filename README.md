scholarship-program
===================

An old program that won a Â£2000 prize

I've recently partically [rewritten this with .net 4.0 features and cleaner code](https://github.com/day-me-an/scholarship-.net4) and ported it [to python](https://github.com/day-me-an/scholarship-python), reducing code by about 70%.
